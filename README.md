Cancer treatment can often be a tedious process. Many times a patient must consult numerous health professionals to receive the best care and spend a prodigal amount of resources for human assistance. The use of neural networks to diagnose Cancer has taken a critical role in presenting the usefulness of the technology. We aim to utilize neural networks to compile the most desirable Cancer treatment plan; this includes treatment factors such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy and is limited to the data available.
